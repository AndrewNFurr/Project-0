# Project-1: Poke-TradR

## Description

The Pokemon trader Application is where Traders can communicate with each other and make Offers. They can ask questions on a post board about the various Trades and Offers, as well as speak directly to each other. They can get a visual representation of the trade along with a list of offers that are on that trade. There will be a log in portal that saves the user and then populates the App with their personal info, restricting access to only their records. Trainers will also be able to create complaints for problematic users as well as view Trainers with complaints to see if they are people they would like to work with.
